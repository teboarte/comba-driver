# Comba-driver 
Install win10 drivers from folder with Powershell and pnputil

## Why use pnputil and powershell ?
When we want to install or update driver on our system, but our windows version does not support the latest .msi driver-package, this is very common in companies using [(LTSC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/whats-new/ltsc/) versions, then we resort to force install with pnputil trhough powershell.

## Devices and windows versions
The Script has been tested on microsoft surface devices with windows ltsb and ltsc versions.

2. SurfacePro
